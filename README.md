CS50 speller problem

This project implements a solution to the CS50x problem set 5 task, "speller," by using
a trie to store the dictionary.

The C program takes as input a dictionary and a text containing words to test. It prints out the misspelled words.

My first effort used a hash table but this one uses the more sophisticated
data structure of a trie.
